110—oe 34. The editors point out that these lines interrupt the argu-
ment, which is to prove the precarious existence of the world, and are
out of place here. There are many such passages, especially in the
last two books; they are rough drafts which Lucr. did not live long

enough to fre-properly into his text. A number of the verses are ‘copied
from his earlier books.

110—145. You must not think it prqfane to deny the divinity and
permanence of tlte exlernal world. T lie mind cannot exist outside
tlte body ,· indeed it can exist only in one special part qf the body
zise-lf. Therefore carth, fire, water, and air cannot have lise and
consequently are not divine.

114. ne——rearisz ne with the ‘znd pers. of the pres. subj. makes a
final clause, not a prohibition, always in Lucr. and generally in writers
of the best period3 in Greek the same rule is invariable. But Horace

122. quae refers back to l. 116, the last 5 11. being parenthetical,
and includes the things enumerated in 1. 115. The MSS. have distent
here and videri, not videntur, below ; this construction is so harsh that
I have admitted the conjecture of Madvig.
