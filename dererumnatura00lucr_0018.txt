affla. The pure taste of Lucretius revolted from the pre-
dominant fashion and attached itself to Ennius, and, through
Ennius, to the classical Greek literature. Thus his philosophi-
cal creed and his literary taste alike led him to discard all
such antiquarian and mythological lore as we see in the Coma
Berenices of Catullus, translated from Callimachus. The myth-
ology he resolute-ly refused to believe, and the only learning he
valued was that which had power to purify the hearts of men
and make their lives happy. .>

His archaism is seen both in the language and in the style.

than that of Ennius, itself is wanting in harmony and especially

in w'ffiety, when compared with the perfect rhythm of Virgil.

 

The difficulty of Lucretius, which even the ancients fe1t¹‚
is partly due to his fondness for archaism, but also to the
inadequacy of the language as an instrument for expressing
abstruse thought. Ennius had been able with rude vigour to
depict the early history of Rome, to lay down a model of heroic
verse for his successors, and to bequeath them a considerable
vocabulary. But the language was still, as Lucretius thrice
over complains²‚ a very imperfect vehicle for the discussion of
political, moral, and metaphysical ideas. The great measure of
success which he attains must have been the result of immense
labour.
