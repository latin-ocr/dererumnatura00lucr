question absolutely, by our own standards and our own prefer-
ences; how should we feel ourselves, if a highly educated
Hindoo asked us to take his word for it, that Marlowe was
a greater poet than Shakespeare‚ or Wordsworth than

Lucretius, either as regards his philosophy or his art. Though
his imagination pays homage to that of the older poet; though
he acknowledges his contemplative elevation ; though he has a
strong affinity with the deep humanity of his nature 3 yet in his

It will be observed that in many of the passages of Virgil
where we find an echo of Lucretius, the sense is quite different
though the words are like or even identical. This is most
easily accounted for, by supposingthat his mind was so saturated
with the writings of his predecessor, that he reproduced the
cadences and even words without being conscious of it. An
example may be taken from another pair of Latin poets. Every
reader of Martial is struck by the number of allusions to
Catullus and imitations of him. But there are also resemblances
of a subtler kind. For instance, Catullus in one of his poems
reproaches Calvus for sending him a present of some bad poetry‚

and vows to take revenge by sending him a similar present in
return :
