and perfectly happy. But this happiness would be perturbed if
they sympathised with the sorrows of men. Therefore he held

that they were absolutely regardless of human afl'airs and
indifferent to our merits or demerits. Their body consists of
atoms so fine as to be invisible to our senses; they liv—essn
spaces between worlds (μετακόςῑμια, intermundia), where no
storms ever come. It is certain from the evil in the world
that the gods had no hand in making it.

This theory is beset with difficulties, which might perhaps
have been removed if Lucretius had fulfilled his intention of

explaining it at large1. But in fact the gods are quite out of
place in the system Qf Epicurus. Their place is occupied by
Nature which is conceived, at all events b Lucretius as an
fixed laws. If the Epicurean gods are included in the universe
and are formed of atoms‚ as we are told, how can they escape
the general law that all combinations of atoms had a beginning

and must have an end? To give a satisfactory answer, Epicurus
must have sacrifieed the unity of his system.

(5) THE HEAVENLY BODIEs. His theory of knowledge led
EpiQQQQEverything,

he said, which can be tested by the senses and is confirmed by
them, is true; again, opinions which cannot be brought to this
test and at the same time are not contradicted by it, are all
equally true. Thus it is a certain truth that the sun is really
about the same size as it appears to us to be, because a fire
on earth, so long as it is visible, does not diminish in size2.
But to say that the stars and the sun must move from some
one controlling cause, or that eclipses admit of only one expla-
nation, is a vain unphilosophical assumption. For these things
are beyond our powers of observation, and there are many
ways of explaining them, none of which is contradicted by the
evidence of the senses, and each of which must be true, if not
sor our world, sor some one of the countless worlds contained in

the universe.
