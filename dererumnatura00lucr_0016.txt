xii INTROD U C Τ] ON.

Days of Hesiod, the Georgics of Virgil‚ the Essay on Man of
Pope, all belong to this class of poetry. The subject which the
poem of Lucretius is intended to explain is the Ehilosophical
system of Epicutuapr part of it. A short account is given
below of such Epicurean doctrines as are explained or alluded
to in the fifth book of Lucretius.

The form and title of the poem are derived from‘Eoncles
of Agrigentum, who lived m the fifth century Β. C. and wrote a
famous treatise in hexameter verse, ‘ri-epi φύσεωςξ of which
some fragments are extant. The poem*- 1s dedicated to Gaius
Memmius, prominent as an orator and statesman of the sena—
torial party, but a worthless and unprincipled man3 why
Lucretius thought him worthy of this distinction, we cannot
tell. No other contemporary is mentioned in the poem, though
some editors have thought they could trace allusions to Clodius
and to Caesar.

The first two books are devoted to a very full account of

atoms and void, these being, according to Democritus and

ΗΒΕ-Ἠῶ, the two great factors of the univers e; here too the
rival systems of other philosophers are stated and refuted.

There is less evidence of incompleteness in these books than in
y the others. The third book is mainly taken up in proving that

the soul is a material part of man, made up of atoms as e
thQy. This theory is of the highest

importance in the eyes of Lucretius and is therefore proved at
great length. The fourth book explains the Epicurean theory
of sight and the other sense53 the fifth gives an account of the
origin of the world, of lise, and of human society; of this book
a fuller analysis is given below. The last book is miscellaneous
in its contents. It begins by discussing the nature of thunder
and lightning and other celestial phenornena; it then deals with
various natural curiosities‚ such as magnetic attraction, and
ends with a description, taken from Thucydides, of the plague

of Athens. It is obviously more confused and less complete
than any of the other books.

T hus it will be seen that Lucretius begins by laying down
the first principles of the atomic philosophy, and then discusses
