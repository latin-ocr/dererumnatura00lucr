viii PREFA ΟΕ.

The text is in the main that of Munro's last edition3 but
ἶ have admitted a few conjectures of Madvig and more
recent writers. All such deviations from Munro's text are
indicated.

In writing the notes I have constantly consulted Munro’s
commentary‚ and I have also kept before me the editions of
Professor Kelsey (Boston 1884) and of MM. Benoist and
Lantoine (Paris 1884), both of which are based on Munro
but contain some original matter. But, owing to the class of
students whom I had in view, it was impossible for me to
follow any of these closely 3 and the notes are for the most
part of my own writing. Finally Ι have to thank Dr J. P.
Postgate, Fellow of Trinity College‚ who most kindly
offered to read over the notes and made many suggestive
crltlclsrns.
