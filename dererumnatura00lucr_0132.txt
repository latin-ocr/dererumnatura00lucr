1028—1090. Languoge arose from a natural instinct to denote
dzfferent things by dzfferent names. children try to speak bqfhre
tlzey are able to do so, just as young animals instz'nctively exert
their peculiar powers. It is not true that some one man invented
the names of things and taught everyonc elsc,· no single man could
have conceived such an idea, nor would others have been willing to
learn from him. T ltere is nothing in the ortgin of language to
surprise us, if we reflect tlzat even animals express diffi’rent emotions
in quite diffi’rcnt lones ,· this may be obscrved in dags, horscs, and
birds of many kinds.

names of things were arbitrarily fixed or arose naturally, whether
