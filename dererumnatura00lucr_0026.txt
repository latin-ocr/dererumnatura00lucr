IV. SOME DOCTRINES OF EPICURUS. 3⁴⁴<2‘270351

Philosophus nobilis, a quo non solum Graecia et ltalia sedetiam
omnis barbaria commota est.
Cicero De Fin. ii 49.

Ep-iQus was born at S-aLn-os ins'f342 B.C. He went to
Ath-ens when he was thirty—five years ol‘d‘and there founded a
school of his own, in which he taught until his death imflgssc.
He was almost worshipped by his disciples and was by all
accounts a most amiable and excellent man, and not at all an
Epicurean in our sense of the term. Before 200 B.C. his system
had found many supporters at Rome, though it was not so
congenial to the gravitas of the Roman character as the rival
system of the Stoics. The doctrines os Epicurus, which are
explained or mentioned by Lucretius in his fifth book, must be
briefly noticed here. These are,

(3)”‘the nature of knowledge;

(4)'‘ the existence and nature of the σ, ods;
(5) ”the thCQAESCl-esjial phenomena.

(1) AT9MS AND.Y01D. Epicurus adopted in its entirety
the atomic theory offfig’mocritus‚ born in 4-20 Ebc. According
to this theory the whole universe consists of two things, bgdy
(σῶμα, cogpus), and vgid (τὸ κενόν, influe). The existence of
body or matter is proved by the evidence of our semes, the
existence of void partly by the possibility of motion, as bodies
could not move if there were no void or empty space for them
to move in, and partly by the unequal weight of bodies equal in
bulk: a ball of lead is heavier than a ball of wool only because
it contains less void. All body, which we may call matter, is
composed of atoms‚ to which Lucretius gives the names prin-
czspia, perrdia re—rum, corpe-ra malms-gae. These atoms differ
