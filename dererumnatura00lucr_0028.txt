Death therefore is nothing to us, as sensation cannot survive
for a moment the separation of body and soul.

is mainly due to their sear of punishment in a future life.

(3) PERCEPTIONS ΛΝΒ CONCEPTioNs. Al] knowledge,
accffidirtg-tQuruS, depends on the senses. Their evidence
is unimpeachable: when we get a wrong impression of some
object we see, the blame rests, not with our sensation, but with
our judgment of the sensation, i.e. with the mind, not with the
eyes. By a repetition of the same perception there arises a
conception or notion (vrpfflqxltcs), which is called by Lucretius
nofflies, and more accurately by Cicero antici atio. This notion

 

is a general picture, retained in the mind, of what has been
perceived. The origin of perceptions is explained in the
following way. Exceedingl fine films (ειδωλα, ''szmulacra) are

CQQQs
bQ of the body itself. These films move

with infinite speed through void and are conveyed to the soul
by the various organs of sense. When we see a horse, an
image has come from the horse and passed through our eyes
into the soul. Taste, hearing, and smell are explained in just
the same way; only the atoms of smells travel slower than the
atoms of sounds, and the atoms of sounds slower than the
atoms of visible things. Thought also is excited entirely by
material images; if we think of a Centaur‚ our thought is
due to an image of a horse which has got mixed up with the
image of a man. Lucretius goes so sar as to say that when
we dream os dead friends, our dream is due to a material
image of them; but it seems impossible to explain how any-
thing that no longer exists can discharge an image. F inally to
images is ascribed the origin of belief in the gods; but here too
there is some inconsistency¹.
