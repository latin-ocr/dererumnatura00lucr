in size, shape, and weight, and are unlimited in number. They
have existed from everlasting and can never be split up or
destroyed in any way, because they are solid and indivisible,
containing no void. They are *in constant motion, being
impelled downwards by their own weight and sideways by the
blows of other atoms; they are so srnall that our sight cannot
perceive thern. Void also is unlimited in extent 3 and so the
universe, which is made up of these two constituents, is also
unlimited. A finite world such as ours, including earth, sea,
and sky, is formed whe'never a concourse of atonis, after many
fruitless experiments‚ have assumed positions which enable
them to move for a time without separating from one another.
But a world so formed, as it had a beginning, will also have
an end3 and the liberated atoms will then continue their racel
through void and take part in future combinations. All—these

It was certainly a happy intuition that induced Epicurus,
indifferent as he was to science in general, to adopt this scien-
tific theory. His contemporaries thought it ridiculous, but
modern science has accepted it as true in the main. ‘The
propositions in which Lucretius has stated his atomic theory
anticipate some recent discoveries in both chemistry and physics
in a most marvellous way. Science has now proved that his
propositions as to the constitution of matter are either certainly
true, or else foreshadow the truth¹.'

(2) THE-SO-UL. The psychology of Epicurus is strictly
materialistic, and admits no difference between mind and
matter. Just as the body is made up of atoms, so is the—Q}
or vital rinciple (xlx-375, amma), and the mind or rational
principle (λόγος, anzmus). The only difserence„ is that the soul
and mind consist of the smallest and lightest atoms; this is
proved by the speed of thought and by the fact that the body,
when life has ceased‚ is not diminished in size and weight.
The vital principle is diffused over the whole body; the rational
principle has its seat inithe breast. The soul, under which
both anima and animus may be included, cannot exist apart
