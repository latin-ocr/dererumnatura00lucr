'contact with other rnen, as the literature he loved belonged
entirely to the past. He was before all things a student. Much
of his time must have been spent in study of the Greek philo-
sophers and poets: he tells us himself that the 'absorbing
pursuit of his life, which he carried on through ‘the clear
nights' and which haunted him even in sleep1‚ was the study
of the philosophers and the exposition in his poem of their
‘glorious discoveries.' According to tradition, his master Epi—
curus himself lest three hundred rolls‚ ‘golden words‚’ says
Lucretius, ‘on which I seed like a bee among the flowers².' And
besides Epicurus there are many other abstruse and voluminous
writers whose authority he acknowledges or whose dogmas he
refutes; Empedocles and DQritus are conspicuous among
the first, HeQstUS and Anax—agoras among the second. He
also translates from or imitates the following Greek authors:
Homer, Hesiod‚ Euripides, Thucydides, Hippocrates, and per-
haps Aristophanes and Plato. Among Latin writers, we can
trace iinon of EQus and his neQ Pacuvius, the ‹gh-ies
eQPOEt and the chief tragedian of early Latin literature.
Finally, from the truth and evident pleasure with which he
describes all manner of natural objects and illustrates his
arguments by them, we may infer that his life was spent for the

most part in the country. We may think of Lucretius in some
quiet place, away from ‘the smoke and wealth and noise of
Rome'3 we may fancy him watching the clouds on the hills or

the waves on the shore with the delight of a poet and the
keen interest of a philosopher, or poring over the scrolls of

Epicurus, and studying how he might best transfer their
precious contents to his own immortal poem.
