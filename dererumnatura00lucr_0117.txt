705—750. T he phases of the moon may be explained in various ways.
She may derive her light from the sun, so that she is at the full
when she is right opposite him, but gradually loses lter lzgrlzt as she
approaclzes him, and is quite dark when between tlte earth and the
sun. Or lter ltjglzt may be her own, and the phases may be due to an
opaque satellite of her own which is constantly getting in her way and
slmtting out her lzgrlzt from us. Or it may be true, as tlte C haldaeans
teaclz, that she is a sphere os wlzz'clz only one half is hagam the
revolution of such a sphere would bring about the phases wc see. Or,
lastly, a fresh moon may be born every day, each with a dffrent
phase, in regular succession; we see many things come round in
regular successim, assor instance thesimr seasons.
